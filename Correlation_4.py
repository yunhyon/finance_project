'''
1. Generate N(e.g. 10,000) pairs of M Normal random variables, X_1,X_2, ..., X_M.
   X_i and X_j are correlated with the correlation coefficient, \rho_ij = \rho_ji, where i = 1,2,...,M, j = i = 1,2,...,M
   The number of distinguishable \rho_ij=\rho_ji is M*(M-1)/2. rho(X_1,X_1), rho(X_1,X_2), ..., rho(X_1,X_M), rho(X_2,X_1), ..., rho(_M,X_M)
   You need to use concepts in Linear Algebra for this many random variable case.
